// supplyGraph.js
//
// The supply-chain dependency graph + downstream stress propagation engine.
//
// Edges run SUPPLIER → CUSTOMER (direction of goods). When a node shows
// bottleneck signals — transcript language saying it can't make enough
// (constrained_supplier) or XBRL backlog outrunning revenue — that stress
// propagates DOWNSTREAM along edges: its customers are at risk of not
// getting parts, while the bottleneck owner itself gains pricing power.
//
// The graph is hand-curated from documented supplier relationships
// (customer-concentration disclosures, partner announcements, teardowns).
// Edit freely: nodes/edges here are the model the engine runs on.
//
// criticality: 3 = sole/dominant source or critical input, 2 = major
// supplier, 1 = meaningful but substitutable.

// ── NODES ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
// layer drives the left-to-right layout: raw inputs flow toward hyperscalers.
// type "external" = non-investable chokepoint (no ticker); baseStress gives
// externals a standing stress level (e.g. China export controls) since they
// have no transcripts or filings to score them with.
